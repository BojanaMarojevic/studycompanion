Study Companion is a functional prototype developed for the purposes of the Human-Computer Interaction Design course. It showcases a range of features  that cater to the needs of students in the academic world. Firstly, the registration and login mechanisms empower users to create accounts and access the platform securely. Once logged in, users can add new assignments, providing assignment names, due dates, subjects, additional notes and to do tasks. The reminder system complements this feature, allowing users to note important deadlines and activities. Additionally, Study Companion fosters communication by enabling users to initiate conversations, ask questions, and engage with fellow users. 
While Study Companion includes a chat feature that appears to allow communication between users, it's important to note that this feature isn't currently operational. We decided to leave it out because of its complexity and also because our primary objective was to fix the violations noted by our evaluators, which took precedence over fully implementing the chat functionality. Instead, we provided a demonstration of how the chat could potentially function in the future.
